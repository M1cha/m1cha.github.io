<p>The MMB322-Toolbox is a application for the Android set-top box “Meteorit MMB322″ from PEARL.
    <br> More information about this product is available in the shop: <a href="http://www.pearl.de/a-PX1534-1600.shtml" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.pearl.de']);" rel="nofollow" title="" class="ext-link ext-icon-2" target="_blank">http://www.pearl.de/a-PX1534-1600.shtml</a></p>
<p>The main purpose of the toolbox was to provide a easy way to root the box via network-adb.
    <br> But in later versions I added much more features like installing android-market, recovery-reboot, editing build.prop and executing adb-shell commands.</p>
<p>The application is written in Java and uses SWING for the user interface.
    <br> It contains native adb-clients for Linux, Mac and Windows and automatically uses the correct binary so it runs on all major operating systems.</p>
<p>All information about this toolbox(download, changelog, source) can be found in this german forum:
