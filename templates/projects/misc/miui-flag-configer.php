<p>The MIUI flag configer is my first android app and was a solution to give the user the ability to configure the custom rom he is about to install.
    <br> As you can guess from the name it was designed for the MIUI rom but it works with Cyanogenmod or any other rom, too.</p>

    <br> The flag configer is just an user interface for reading and changing these flags. Everything else is done by the installation script.</p>
