<p>On Motorola Defy a userspace application called “bootmenu” is used to intercept boot process and allow loading custom recovery and roms.
    <br> The UI of this application copied from “Clockworkmod Recovery” and does not provide touch functionality.</p>
<p>That’s why I rewrote the whole UI to change that. I added a more touch-friendly UI and added touch support to input handling.</p>
<p>Later when the goal of this project was reached I’ve completely integrated this into <a title="MultiBoot" href="/projects/misc/defy-multiboot.html">Multiboot</a> to provide easy-to-use Multiboot features.</p>
